        <title>2015 The Goals List</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An idea came to me at the end of 2014 - in 2015 I would create one thing each month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating something is fun, but is often hard and takes a long time. Due to this very nature, we often build less than we’d like and never really create a habit of producing our own &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve decided to try and release a new project each month and write about it here in hopes of creating a habit of releasing my own creations out into the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining a “project” was difficult at first. Should it be personal projects? Should it be client projects? I realized limiting what I make to personal or client categories detracts from the goal of simply &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;making something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. So the goal of producing something each month in 2015 is a mixture of personal projects and client projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Goals List is on the home page in a listed format. You can also read a little more in-depth on each page, or &lt;a href=&quot;/goals&quot;&gt;check out the goals page as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/goals&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-project&quot;&gt;View Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finally A &quot;New&quot; Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me forever but I finally built a “new” site. When I say “new” I just mean something that wasn’t a landing page with basically nothing on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit more built out, granted nothing that’s worth a huge award or “ohh-ing” and “aww-ing”. Just something that is better than what I had before and is an actual system that allows editing/updating to happen a lot easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this site, I decided to build on a static CMS I haven’t tried before - Jekyll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m familar with liquid templating but haven’t really used it too much and figured this would be a great opportunity to get into something new for a quick weekend project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping this new site and CMS will enable me to write more and document my work frequently. I’m totally aware this won’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; me write, but considering it’s pretty easy, maybe I’ll be more open to the idea of documenting the stuff I do in my life, personally and professionally. &lt;/p&gt;
