With the third season of [The Start](http://thestart.fm) done I finally have some time to discuss how it panned out. 

The first thing to note is the third carried on without our original co-host, Nick. He decided to work on something else and insisted it carry on, so I went on! 

And since I became the podcast's sole-owner, I made the decision to not seek advertising. Mainly because of time but also because I felt cheap trying to leverage my audience and guests for money. Especially when I was unable to guarantee the effectiveness of the advertisements. 

With those two things squared away, I was able to focus on the podcast and create a season I believe was varied in guests and topics.
