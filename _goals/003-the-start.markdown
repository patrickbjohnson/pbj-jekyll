The month of February I'm organizing a cookie-tasting event called Beta Tasting.

Some of you know I bake cookies. Some of you just found out and you've missed out on a lot. 


In an attempt to get feedback I often baked cookies and shared them with my friends. Since most friends are tech-foklk we dubbed it *Beta Tasting*.

From there *Beta Tasting* was born and is now looking to be a monthly event bringing friends and cookie-lovers together to nom nom on some delicious baked goods. 

The first *Beta Tasting* is happening on March 8. Ticekts go for $5 and all money goes towards the cost to bake (ingredients, chocolate).
