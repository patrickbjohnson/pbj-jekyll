The goal for February is dedicated to cookies.

I began baking cookies as a way to just do something completely removed from development and its grown into something  I really enjoy doing.

To get feedback and make these cookies better, I'm starting a monthly tasting series called ***Beta Tasting***. The idea is to bring friends together to hang out, have some fun and enjoy some good cookies.

The first Beta Tasting is happening on ***March 8***.
