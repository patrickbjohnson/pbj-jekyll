Throughout January I wokred with Hammer + Nail and Almanac to bring this new west-village restaurant to life online. 

We created a site that brings the most important thing foward: *the food*. 

We decided to use Wordpress for its solid foundation and quick development to build a site that was both beautiful and functional. 

The first thing our client wanted was an easily-managed site. Considering anyone on the team may update the sites menu or content, they needed something intuitive and clear.
