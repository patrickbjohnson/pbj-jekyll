In January I partnered with agency Hammer + Nail to create a digital experience for a new, west-village restaurant, Almanac. 

Almanac isn’t just another restaurant. The Chef is top-chef contestant Galen Zamarra and his take on micro-seasons fits perfectly into Almanac’s tasting-menu style of dining. 

Almanac didn’t want a typical restaurant menu, they wanted to focus on the most important part: *the food and people*.

Understanding their clientele, Almanac knew they needed a mobile-first site with a menu conducive to phones and bandwidth. No longer do you have to download bit, clunky PDFs on Almanac’s site. Now you can just load up the menu page and check out the menu on any given night. 

If you haven’t been its definitely worth experiencing a micro-seasonal tasting menu.
