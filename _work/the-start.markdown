When I dipped my toe into web development there was one question on my mind: How did other web developers and designers break into the industry?

That single question spurred a podcast spanning two seasons and counting, interviewing 20+ guests from all corners of the globe discussing one thing: how their journey has shapped their life and career.

This is defintely a passion project and glad folks take time out of their day to chat with me. 

Now stop reading and go listen to some episodes!
