Soma Water approached me to develop the front-end of their Black Friday project, Soma Water Black.

Soma Water Black is a limited edition water filter they sold on on Black Friday. All proceeds went to charity so this project was not only fun technically-speaking, but also fun because we gave directly back to those in need. 

In two weeks I worked with Creative Director, Liang Shi, and rails dev-shop, JAKT, to create a mobile-first experience selling the limited edition Soma Water Black carafe + filter. 

The project was incredibly success and sold out all inventory in 24 hours.
