Startups are all the rage. Everyone and their mom either has one of their own or works at a startup. 

While this is great for the American economy, it can get tiring. After reviewing some startups I realized a lot of the mission statements posted were, well, fluffy. 

So as a result I created 'What Does Your Startup Do?' as a satire site displaying vague statement seeming to fit the bill of an average startup.
