Picofemto is a health start-up based in New York city whose site and brand needed a refresh before seekign funding. 

As the Front-End Developer, I worked with Text100's in-house design team to build out a brand to match its current philosophy and personality. 

The end result was a mobile-first site built with forward thinking technology while maintaining usabilty for Internet Explorer 8 users.
