Picofemto is a health start-up based in New York city who's site and brand needed a refresh before seeking a new round of funding. 

As the Front-End Developer, I worked with Text100's design team to build brand to match Picofemto's current philosophy and personality. 

The end result was a mobile-first site built with some fun modern technology (SVG for the win!) while maintaining usabilty for their Internet Explorer 8 users.
