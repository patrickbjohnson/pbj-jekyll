After graduating college I was, like most, astounded by the idea of a salaried job. But with that came a curiosity to see how much money I was *really* making. 

I did some quick math and realize it wasn't as much as expected and thought the same formula could be useful to friends and folks online. 

I created a quick little website using jQuery to calculate a person's hourly rate based on their current salary. 

The result is What's My Hourly Rate.
