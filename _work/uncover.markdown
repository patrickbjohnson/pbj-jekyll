Uncover.com asked me to lend a hand rebuildling the Front-End in time for their site relaunch with a brand new web app. Uncover has a really tall order - to launch a new site with everything completely rebuilt (design, front-end and back-end).

I worked with Uncover's founder, Spencer, and the rest of the team to rebuild the site to work with the updated back-end and proposed functionality.
