## The Setting
Hammer + Nail approached me to work with their team, and client, to build a mobile-first, responsive site representing Almanac, a new West Village restaurant.

## The Challenege
Throughout the exploration and design phase it was clear there were two focal points of the site: *menu accessibiltiy and food*. 

Since Almanac specializes in micro-seasonal dishes, its paramount their guests understands the mission of the restaruant while having fast and easy access to a frequently-changing menu. 

On the backend, Almanac needed an manageble CMS allowing all members of the team to jump in and edit content when necessary.  

## The Solution
After working through the design, we settled on creating a flexible and easy-to-use system that focused on the menu as its the heart of Almanac.

We couldn't create a run-of-the-mill website leveraging PDFs for the menu. This strategy, while it works, isn't really user friendly. Almanac didn't want their guests taking time to download a potentially large PDF and really wanted to keep content consistent and available on their new website. 

The final product resembles the the clients source of inpspiration: an almanac. 

Almanac now has ability to manage content as three different layers: the Dish, the Dish Type, the Menu.

### The Dish
The dish is the starting point. It can be as abstarct or specific as Almanac would like. This dish isn't tied to any menu or dish type in particular since flexibility is incredibly important for a restaurnt that changes their menu daily.

### The Dish Type
Almanac has three dish types: Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert. Rather than permanently tying a dish to a particular type, we leveraged custom taxonomies to create categories that can be applied to any dish. 

### The Menu 
Since Almanac technically has three menus (with the addition of holiday menus) it was important to leverage categories here to allow the client to create new menus, edit existing menus, add or remove dishes to menus, and manage the display controls of menus as well. 

We used categories to manage the display of dishes on the menu, and the display of the menu online. Almanac can now easily turn a menu's display on or off quickly and can add dishes to any menu. 


## The End Result
The end result is what you see at <a href="{{page.url}}">{{page.url}}</a>. A mobile-first site that embodies the spirit of the restaurant while giving quick access to the most important parts: *the food*.
