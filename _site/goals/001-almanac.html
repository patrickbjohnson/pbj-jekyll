      <p>While buildling Almanac, I decided to try out Zurb’s Foundation framework. I figured since it was a Framework I’d have very little ramp-up and would be able to figure out any nuances from their documentation and stackoverflow.</p>

<p>I was interested to play with Foundation since I’ve only messed with Bootstrap out of client necessity so I figured this would be a great chance to learn a new framework to better way my options.</p>

<p>Since I use Grunt in my workflow I knew I could just integrate Foundation into my process pretty easily. But then realized since this site was built on Wordpress, it might get a little tricky. Luckily the world of open-sourced projects came to save the day and I was able to use FoundationPress which did exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>Aside from FoundationPress’ few opinions the framework integrated into the project seamlessly. I noticed however that Foundation has a few caveats of its own. Things like floating the last item in a row to the right and what not had to be overridden but nothing within Foundation ever really held up my process.</p>

<p>FoundationPress, however, did have a few hiccups along the way. The size of the project itself was enormous. For the first time in my development career I hit IE’s 4095 selector limits. Upon further inspection <em>all</em> of Foundation was being included in this project and I’d need to cut stuff down to only the necessities in order to work in IE9.</p>

<p>Other than the one small hiccup of IE’s selector rule everything went pretty smoothly. I happen to like the difference in naming (or opinion) that Foundation carries when it comes to rows<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Not sure I have a clear winner in the framework game but this gave me a good opportunity to try something new while still being productive.</p>
