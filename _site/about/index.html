      <h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<p>In high school I knew one thing: I was going to college. 
I picked my major based on the “cool factor” of each major. I entered my freshman year of college as a Journalism Major because free clothes sounded pretty awesome (fashion journalism was the goal).</p>

<h2 id="college">College</h2>
<p>I quickly realized Journalism is hard and not guaranteed. The opposite of what people told me life would be like with a college degree so I changed to Public Relations because I heard it was a more reliable career and paid more overtime.</p>

<p>My junior year of college I did one semester at NYU to get a taste of the city. I figured since New York City is the #1 media market I should probably go there for work. This was a perfect way to see if I could make it work in New York considering I never visited before that winter semester.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-pt-1">Real World Pt. 1</h2>
<p>My NYU plan worked out. I had a job immediately after graduating at a small advetising agency in Chelsea. I was an account executive and couldn’t be happier. I worked with a big name client, American Express and felt like gold. Then I realized all we did were emails. And sometimes banner ads.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-pt-2">Real World Pt. 2</h2>
<p>After the first agency I ran through a few more. Trying to find the perfect balance of agency life, clients, projects (and project budget) and colleagues. But nothing ever really fit. In fact I pretty much hated what I was doing. Not because we were stealing from people or telling lies but because I wasn’t stimulated and felt like I was unable to give my best effort in any capacity. Partly due to company politics on the account-team side and partly because my heart wasn’t in it.</p>

<p><strong>On February 13, 2013 I was laid off from Digitas.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-decision">The Decision</h2>
<p>At that point I was faced with a decision: go get another job I hated or change my career. Out of shock I applied to one place for a strategist position but then realized it was worthless. Luckily I landed one last freelance gig as a strategist and created some cushion in my bank account. At that point I knew I was going to focus on what would make me happy in my professional life: web development.</p>

<h2 id="the-current">The Current</h2>
<p>And thats’s where I am now. I’m a web developer and I love what I do. Everyday I get to do what I really enjoy doing. Everyday I get to really challenge myself mentally and provide value to people who appreciate what I do.</p>

<p>I build at work, I build for freelance clients, I build for personal projects and just to learn new things. I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
