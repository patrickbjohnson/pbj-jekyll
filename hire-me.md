So you've gotten to this page because maybe you want to work together or you've just randomly clicked this link. 

Either way, here are some things to know about working together: 

<dl>
	<dt>I Love What I Do</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This work is my life. It's how I find joy and how I pay bills. It's the craft I slave over to perfect.</p>
		<p>It means I take projects seriously and I expect you do too. I hope when we work together we are organized and communicate as clearly as possible. We don't surprise one another with last minute changes or unexpected problems. We respect each other's time and value what we both bring to the project. The more honest we are with one another (and ourselves), the more successful the project.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>What Do You Charge?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>While buying a car with my mother I asked how much a car cost, my mother responded, "It depends."</p>
		<p>No two sites are the same. You might be simliar to another client, but it doesn't mean you sell the same products, you have the same audience, you have the same objectives or have the same problems. Each project (and client) is unique.</p>
		<p>This doesn't mean we (developers) get to make up prices, it means the price isn't the same for everyone. </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>How Do You Determine Price?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Prices are based on a variety of things (but not limited to): complexity, time, budget, ease of working together, my schedule, etc.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>What's Your Hourly Rate?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><strong>I do not do hourly pricing for new clients</strong>. Hourly pricing puts us at odds on a strictly financial level: the quicker I work the more money the client saves, the slower I work the more money the client spends.</p>
		<p>Hourly pricing presumes we are not in this work together. False. We are in this together, 100% of the time, all the way to the end.</p>
		<p><strong>I work on project based pricing</strong>. We work together to figure out what you need to solve your challenges and what price is suitable for you. Since we're in this together we'll work together, from start to finish.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind we might not be a great fit for a variety of reasons. If that is the case, and that's okay. I'll do my best to refer you to a colleague who fits your project best.</p>
		<p>If we've launched a project together in the past then I may consider an hourly rate on smaller, one-off projects.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>How Soon Can You Start?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I take it you've read all the above and agree? <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">Email me</a> and lets talk about your project and how we can work together to bring it to life.</p>
