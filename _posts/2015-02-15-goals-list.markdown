An idea came to me at the end of 2014 - create one thing each month. 

Creating something is fun, but is often hard and sometimes takes a long time. Due to this very nature, we often build less than we'd like and never really create a habit of producing things.

So, I've decided I would try and release a new project each month and write about it here in hopes of creating a habit of shipping publicly. 

This project can be a client related project or a personal project. Either way, I'll release something new each month.

The Goals List is on the home page in a listed format. You can also read a little more in-depth on each page, or [check out the goals page as well]({{baseurl}}/goals).
