An idea came to me at the end of 2014 - in 2015 I would create one thing each month. 

Creating something is fun, but is often hard and takes a long time. Due to this very nature, we often build less than we'd like and never really create a habit of producing our own *things*.

So, I've decided to try and release a new project each month and write about it here in hopes of creating a habit of releasing my own creations out into the world. 

Defining a "project" was difficult at first. Should it be personal projects? Should it be client projects? I realized limiting what I make to personal or client categories detracts from the goal of simply ***making something***. So the goal of producing something each month in 2015 is a mixture of personal projects and client projects.

The Goals List is on the home page in a listed format. You can also read a little more in-depth on each page, or [check out the goals page as well]({{baseurl}}/goals).
