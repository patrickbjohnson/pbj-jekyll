A few weeks ago I responded to a prospective client about scheduling a call. I wrote:

    "Feel free schedule time here: https://calendly.com/XXX/yyy"

A few days later I did that again but had to find the link because it wasn’t in my clipboard history.

Another prospective client asked me about rates and "how I charge". So I wrote a quick email outlining those items.


    My pricing options are as follows:
    - Hourly: $$$
    - Daily: $$$
    - Weekly: $$$
    - Retainers: Minimum 16hours/month - $$$
    - Flat Fee: TBD based on project scope that we'd define together.

From that day on, whenever someone asks about my rates I paste this script into an email and hit send. That’s when it hit me, I can write a script!

Now when I write something I think I’ll need again I create a script. The point is for me to write it once and use it anytime I need it.

When a company calls or emails, I read or paste the script. Overtime I’m sure I’ll edit the script and keep revisions to compare notes, update for more successful phrasing, etc.

The scripts I’ve written so far:

- About Me & Progress Labs
- Pricing Options
- Bio (different than About Me)
- Common Pricing Rebuttals

Bonus: I recently purchased an app called [aText](http://www.trankynam.com/atext/) which is a text-expander. This saved me from searching my clipboard history or going to links for things like calendly, mailing addresses or bank info. Definitely worth the $5!
