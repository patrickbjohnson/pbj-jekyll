summary: "I finally got around to making a new site!"
---
It took me forever but I finally built a "new" site. When I say "new" I just mean something that wasn't a landing page with basically nothing on it. 

This is a bit more built out, granted nothing that's worth a huge award or "ohh-ing" and "aww-ing". Just something that is better than what I had before and is an actual system that allows editing/updating to happen a lot easier. 

For this site, I decided to build on a static CMS I haven't tried before - Jekyll. 

I'm familar with liquid templating but haven't really used it too much and figured this would be a great opportunity to get into something new for a quick weekend project. 

I'm hoping this new site and CMS will enable me to write more and document my work frequently. I'm totally aware this won't *make* me write, but considering it's pretty easy, maybe I'll be more open to the idea of documenting the stuff I do in my life, personally and professionally.
